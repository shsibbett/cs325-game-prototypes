<h2>Misstep</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
    <li>The player must escape from a room without touching the walls.</li>
    <li>The walls are invisible.</li>
    <li>A red x is left behind wherever a player touches a wall.</li>
    <li>The player leaves behind a white trail showing where they have been to help them get through the room.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
    <li>The trail that shows where the player has walked safely before is generated using bit map data.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
    <li>I learned how to change the visibility of sprites and how to have the player die on collision.</li>
    <li>I also learned how to use bit maps to create a trail and how to create checkpoints for the player.</li>
    <li>The easiest part was changing the visibility of the walls and to add red x's where the player died.</li>
    <li>The hardest part was creating a tilemap that wasn't too hard for the player to find their way through.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul> 
    <li>The code for player movement was taken from the Phaser <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/starstruck#gv">Starstruck</a> example.</li>
    <li>I used code from the Phaser <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/ship-trail">Ship Trail</a> example to generate the dot trail.</li>
    <li>I used both the <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/tweens/alpha-text">Alpha Text</a> and <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/tweens/chained-tweens">Chained Tweens</a> examples from Phaser for the "Checkpoint reached!" text.</li>
    <li>Code from the <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/audio/sound-complete">Sound Complete</a> Phaser example was used for reloading the door sprite after the door opening/closing sound effect.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<ul>
    <li>You have been captured by a murderous psychopath and must escape.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<ul>
    <li>I used the caught theme.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
    <li>The player uses the arrow keys to move.</li>
    <li>There aren't really any random elements aside from how the player actions.</li>
    <li>The game is a 2D, top-down side-scroller.</li>
    <li>The play style is that the player must make mistakes in order to succeed and escape.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
    <li>This prototype is evaluating the mechanic that the player must die repeatedley in order to beat the game.</li>
    <li>X's marking where the player has died, a trail of where they have been, and checkpoints were added to help the player find 
        the exit.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
    <li>Overall, players should have fun and feel like they have been presented with a challenge.</li>
    <li>Hopefully, players should not experience frustration as multiple elements have been added to help them escape the room.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise 
explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the 
prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
    <li>Use the arrow keys to move.</li>
    <li>The player must get to the door in the bottom right corner of the room.</li>
    <li>The player will die if they run into any of the invisible walls, or they will be sent back to the last checkpoint.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul> 
    <li>Use the red x's that appear when you die to avoid walls.</li>
    <li>Use the white trail that appears when you walk to tell where it's safe to go.</li>
    <li>If you are stuck, die as many times as you can to get a visual of where the walls are.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and 
interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
    <li>You were only going downtown to pick up some take-out when you were knocked out suddenly. The next thing you knew, you
        woke up in a pitch-black basement to a man speaking to you. He said that you were free to leave if you could manage to make it the
        exit; the catch: if you touch any of the walls, you die.
    </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<ul>
    <li>I am trying to reach players who enjoy failing over and over until they win.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<ul>
    <li>On average, 5 minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
