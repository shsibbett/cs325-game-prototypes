<h2>Extraction</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
    While most 2-D side-scrolling space games involve the player shooting down enemies and obstacles and collecting power-ups, this game removes
    all that needless excitement and tasks the player with collecting a single item!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    The game runs smoothly without any gitters or bugs (that I know of).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
    I learned the basics of Phaser and how to make a game in general. The easiest part was changing the background color of the Phaser example I chose.
    The hardest part was trying to figure how to do overlap detection using p2 physics.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    I borrowed assets from Phaser: collision_test.json, ground_1x1.png, walls_1x2.png, tiles2.png, thrust_ship.png, diamond.png, explosion.mp3,
    p-ping.mp3, and sd-ingame1.wav.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    This game strongly resembles the Phaser tilemap example. I also used code from the text stroke example for putting text on the game screen and code
    from the overlap without physics example to check when a sprite was overlapping another sprite.

<li><a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/sprites/overlap-without-physics">Overlap Without Physics</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    You are a geologist looking for a rare jewel in a cave on an unnamed planet.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
    I used the geologist theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    I used the 2-D side-scrolling genre. The play style is similar to Asteroids in the way that the ship moves.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    This prototype evaluates the mechanic of being able to collide with certain objects while having to avoid others. It also evaluates the
    mechanic of 'collecting' an item.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
    I want players to have a fun time avoiding fatal collisions and getting the jewel. Some frustation is to be expected upon crashing.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Forward - Up Arrow</li>
<li>Backward - Down Arrow</li>
<li>Rotate Left - Left Arrow</li>
<li>Rotate Right - Right Arrow</li>
<li>Make it to the end of the cave and get the jewel.</li>
<li>Avoid the walls or you will crash.</li>
<li>Rocks are safe to crash into.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
    As the player can touch the rocks in the center of the map and cannot touch the walls, an effective strategy to win fast would involve rocketing
    into rocks while taking it slow near walls.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
    You are a geologist who has been searching several planets for a rare jewel known as rarium that you hope will elevate your status among your 
    peers back on Earth. This obsessive search has taken over your entire life, and you begin to lose hope that you will ever find what you are 
    searching for when you come across a cave on small, nondescript planet...
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
    This game is meant for everyone of all ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
    Depending on the skill of the player, play time can be between 15 seconds to a full minute.
</li>

</ul>
