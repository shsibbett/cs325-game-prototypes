<h2>Digital Assignment 4</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
    <li>Players have to deal with only being able to move in one direction while trying to get across a frozen lake.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
    <li>The game checks whether the player is overlapping with the 'ice' layer of the tilemap and if they are not colliding with 
        rocks.</li>
    <li>If both of these conditions are true, then the player slides.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
    <li>I learned how to check if a sprite is overlapping with a particular layer in a tilemap.</li>
    <li>The easiest part was creating the tilemap and puzzle.</li>
    <li>The hardest part was figuring out the sliding mechanic; it was difficult to program when the player should slide and when 
        they should be allowed to move again.</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://capx.wikia.com/wiki/Trainer_Classes">Hiker</a> sprite</li>
    <li><a href="http://pixelartmaker.com/art/b6fdc68bf6bdd78">Flag</a> sprite</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtMcefR6VT4">Ice Path/Cave</a> music from Pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a> was used to create the tilemap.</li>
    <li><a href="http://capx.wikia.com/wiki/File:Ice_tiles.png">Tileset</a> I used for the ice floor and some of the rocks.</li>
    <li><a href="https://phyromatical.deviantart.com/art/Tons-of-Tileset-5-10-Cool-Gaia-Tiles-486527845">Tileset</a> I used for the smaller rocks.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
    <li>I was partially inspired by the ice puzzles that are found in some of the Pokemon games.</li>
    <li>Player movement code was taken from the Phaser <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/starstruck#gv">Starstruck</a> example.</li>
    <li>Code I used to <a href="http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/25045-sprite-overlaping-with-tilemap-overlap-not-working/">check if a sprite overlapped with a tilemap layer</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<ul>
    <li>You are a hiker who must make his way across a frozen lake.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<ul>
    <li>I used the ice theme.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
    <li>Player uses the arrows to move.</li>
    <li>Player eithers slides or walks normally depending on where they stand.</li>
    <li>This game is taken from the 2D puzzle genre.</li>
    <li>The play style encourages players to think critially about how to get to the goal.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
    <li>The sliding on ice mechanic.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
    <li>Players should feel challenged to solve the puzzle of how to get across the ice.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise 
explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the 
prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
    <li>You must make your way to the upper left corner of the screen where the flag is.</li>
    <li>Use the arrows keys to move.</li>
    <li>You can only walk freely on the snow.</li>
    <li>On ice, you will slide forward until you collide with either a rock or a wall.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul> 
    <li>Think backwards to get to the goal.</li>
    <li>Look at rocks or spaces on the walls that can get you to the goal, and then see how you can get to those places.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and 
interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
