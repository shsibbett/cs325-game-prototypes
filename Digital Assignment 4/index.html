<h2>Digital Assignment 4</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
    <li>Players have to deal with only being able to move in one direction while trying to get a flag and then get across a frozen lake.</li>
    <li>As the player progresses, the ice will crack and will have to avoid holes of water in the lake.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
    <li>The game checks whether the player is overlapping with the 'ice' layer of the tilemap and if they are not colliding with 
        rocks.</li>
    <li>If both of these conditions are true, then the player slides.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
    <li>I learned how to check if a sprite is overlapping with a particular layer in a tilemap.</li>
    <li>The easiest part was creating the tilemap and puzzle.</li>
    <li>The hardest part was figuring out the sliding mechanic; it was difficult to program when the player should slide and when 
        they should be allowed to move again.</li>
    <li>It was also hard designing the puzzle and making sure the player couldn't easily grab the flag or get to the other side of the lake.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
    <li>I was partially inspired by the ice puzzles that are found in some of the Pokemon games.</li>
    <li>Player movement code was taken from the Phaser <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/starstruck#gv">Starstruck</a> example.</li>
    <li>Code I used to <a href="http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/25045-sprite-overlaping-with-tilemap-overlap-not-working/">check if a sprite overlapped with a tilemap layer</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<ul>
    <li>You are a hiker who must take up the flag of the previous expedition and make his way across a frozen lake.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<ul>
    <li>I used the ice theme.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
    <li>Player uses the arrows to move.</li>
    <li>Player eithers slides or walks normally depending on where they stand.</li>
    <li>This game is taken from the 2D puzzle genre.</li>
    <li>The play style encourages players to think critially about how to get to the goal.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
    <li>The sliding on ice mechanic.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
    <li>Players should feel challenged to solve the puzzle of how to get the flag and get across the ice.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise 
explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the 
prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
    <li>You must first collect the red flag, then make your way to the top right corner of the screen.</li>
    <li>Use the arrows keys to move.</li>
    <li>You can only walk freely on the snow.</li>
    <li>On ice, you will slide forward until you collide with either a rock or a wall.</li>
    <li>If you slide into water, you die. Avoid it at all costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul> 
    <li>Think backwards to get to the goal.</li>
    <li>Look at rocks or spaces on the walls that can get you to the goal, and then see how you can get to those places.</li>
    <li>Avoid the water.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and 
interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
    <li>Your name is James Flynn, and you are an amateur mountain hiker looking to gain worldwide reknown with your exploits.
        You are currently attemping to travel the climb up Mt. Erinal and get farther than the last known expedition team. They
        conveniently left a marker at their last camp in the form of a red flag. You find that the flag has been blown across 
        the frozen lake near the campsite. You make it your goal to reach the flag and take it back to the base camp.
